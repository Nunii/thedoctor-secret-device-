# Troubleshooting Guide

## 1. GitHub Actions Configuration
### Issue: Environment Variable References
- **Problem**: Environment variables couldn't reference each other within the `env` block
- **Solution**: Used hardcoded values for non-sensitive information and GitHub's built-in contexts where appropriate

### Issue: Docker Hub Link Masking

- **Solution**: Changed the tje Docker Hub username to be a variable instead of a secret

- **Problem**: Container networking issues in CI environment
- **Solution**: Updated Docker Compose configuration to use proper network settings


## 3. Testing
### Issue: Environment Variables in Tests
- **Problem**: Tests were failing due to missing environment variables
- **Solution**: Created a test configuration file and proper test environment setup

### Issue: Test Coverage
- **Problem**: Some code paths weren't being tested
- **Solution**: Added more test cases and improved test coverage reporting

## 4. Security
### Issue: Secret Management
- **Problem**: Sensitive information was exposed in logs
- **Solution**: Implemented proper secret management using GitHub Secrets

## 5. Documentation
### Issue: Deployment Instructions
- **Problem**: Complex deployment process was hard to document
- **Solution**: Created step-by-step instructions with examples

### Issue: Environment Setup
